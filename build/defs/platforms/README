Filename format:
    defs.platform.<PLATFORM>.mk

Each platform fragment should define the following Makefile variables:
    LINUX_SRC
    CROSS_COMPILE
    LINUX_SRC_MODULE
    PLATFORM_SUPPORTED
    CFLAGS_${PLATFORM} and/or EXTRA_CFLAGS_${PLATFORM}

PLATFORM_SUPPORTED is to be used to track which platforms are supported.
At the time of writing this, it is not known beyond which platforms are
supported by the initial code (beyond PLATFORM=PC). To help prevent
potential losses, all platforms referenced in the original top-level
Makefile will have their own platform definitions file here.
